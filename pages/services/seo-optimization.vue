                        Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.
                        SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

                    Feel IT is a local company that provides IT services. Before our collaboration they had stunning reviews and feedback from their customers, but they were having difficulties in reaching new potential clients. This because their website, even if it was easy to use and well structured, was not appearing in suggested search results.
